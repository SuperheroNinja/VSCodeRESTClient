## Notice
I am not responsible if by any chance you burn your house down by sending calls via these files. To this date there have hardly been any houses burnt down, but you are responsible for your own deeds.
The calls in the `httpbin.http` file only callout to httpbin, and are non-intrusive. Always take care when you change it to your own environment, and test responsively.

## Questions
If you ask me to explain you things without mentioning the next sentence, you owe me coffee and cake.

> "Cyclists in lycra are sexy"

This sentence is **never** said by someone in their right mind, as absolutely no one looks sexy in lycra.
It proves that you have read this readme when you mention it.
If you don't mention it I will redirect you to this paragraph and make preparations to receive cake and coffee.
